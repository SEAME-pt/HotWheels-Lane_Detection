# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
## Introduction
### Base concepts
***Machine learning*** is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that identify patterns in data and improve their performance over time with experience.  
  
***Deep learning*** is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in large datasets. It is especially powerful in tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.  
  
  
### What is CNN?
A CNN is a class of deep learning models specifically designed for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images. Inspired by the human visual cortex, CNNs automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through the use of multiple layers, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. These networks are particularly effective in capturing spatial and temporal dependencies, making them the backbone of modern computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. By reducing the need for manual feature extraction, CNNs have significantly advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence in visual understanding.  
  
  
## Step by step
***1. Convolution layer***  
- Applies filters (kernels) that scan the image.  
- Each filter detects a specific feature (edges, corners, etc).  
- Outputs a feature map (or activation map).  
  
  
***2. Activation function***  
- Usually ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): replaces negative values with zero.  
- Introduces non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns.  
  
  
***3. Pooling layer***  
- Reduces the size of the feature map to make the network faster and less sensitive to exact locations.  
- Common method: Max pooling â€” takes the highest value in a small window (e.g., 2x2)  
  
  
***4. More convolutions and pooling***  
- The network stacks multiple layers to learn higher-level features.  
    -> Early layers: detect edges or textures.  
    -> Deeper layers: recognize parts of objects (like eyes, wheels, etc).  
  
  
***5. Flattening***  
- Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector to pass into the next stage.  
  
  
***6. Fully connected layer***  
- A standard neural network layer that takes the flattened data and produces a final prediction.
