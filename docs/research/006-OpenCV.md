# OpenCV
## Introduction
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source software library focused on real-time computer vision and image processing. Written in C++ with bindings for Python, Java, and other languages, it provides a wide range of tools for tasks like object detection, face recognition, image filtering, and camera calibration. OpenCV is widely used in academic research, robotics, and industrial applications due to its efficiency, portability, and large community support.
