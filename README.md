# HotWheels - Detection Modules 📷 📹
## Introduction
The most important modules of the SEA:ME program are the ones that require detection which is a mandatory feature on any self-driving vehicle. Being able to identify what is in front of the car is extremely important because the base for any autonomous car is the reaction to the environment around it. On the road, in a real life scenario, the main operations that involve detection are the ***lanes*** and the ***objects*** since the car must stay within it's lane and avoid colisions at all cost.  
  
Being so this repository was created to develop said modules as external dependencies of our main [app](https://github.com/SEAME-pt/2024-2025-HotWheels/tree/main). However, detecting is not enough, we must react to it. To do that we were also required to develop a motion control model that would perform actions based on the output of the lane and object detection models.

## Development
Each one of the models referenced above has it's own README in order to better understand how they work and organize the documentation.
